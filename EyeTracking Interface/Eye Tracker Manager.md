## Eye Tracker Manager

In addition to being a graphical application in which you can browse eye trackers and work with selected eye tracker, **you can also launch Eye Tracker Manager with command line arguments to directly trigger its features.** This allows you to reuse some of the features of Eye Tracker Manager instead of implementing your own version (using the Tobii Pro SDK).
